We plan to conduct the next update of our project after the Spring Festival holiday. During this period, our team will carry out the necessary preparations to ensure the update proceeds smoothly.

Although the specific details of the update are still being finalized, we promise to bring some exciting new features and improvements. Please stay tuned, as we will announce more information after the Spring Festival.

If you encounter any problems while using our project, or have any suggestions, feel free to open an issue on GitHub or contact us via email at wenq@cdut.edu.cn.
